# Junimo

Junimo is a Discord bot created for the AD server. Its current features include a QOTD system which posts automatically daily, a Chore of the Day feed which posts twice a day, as well some smaller text features (/uwu)

As this bot is, for the moment, not expected to be used in other servers, some elements from the AD guild are hardcoded into the files. These will be detailed below within each category as well as in a separate section for ease of use.

## Features
