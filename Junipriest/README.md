# Junipriest
Junimo is a Discord bot created for the AD server. Its primary feature is to allow users to anonymously post confessions, which are reviewed and either approved or denied by the server's moderators.</br></br>
It's important to note that no actual permission restrictions in the code. Any restrictions should be made by assigning the confession approval and log channels to role-restricted channels.
