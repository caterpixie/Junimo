# Junisheriff

A Discord bot created for the AD server with the main purpose of moderation; both serious and silly. It has the following features:
- Auto-moderation: slur filter, phishing link detection, link posting rules
- Detailed logging of server events: joined, left, message edits and deleted, voice channel changes and role changes.
- Full manual moderation system with warnings, kicks, bans, mutes and lockdowns. Includes specific rules like auto-kicking after first warn and auto-muting after second warning.
- Silly warning commands
